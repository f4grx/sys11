MULU_16_16: PSHD               ; The HC11 has an 8-bit CPU, and so cannot deal with 16-bit

           LDAA  $09,SP       ; multiplies them together, placing the 32-bit result in 
           LDAB  $07,SP       ; the stack space where the two operands once occupied.
           MUL                ; This routine doesn't need any static variables, but it
           STD   $02,SP       ; does use 10 bytes of stack space, including the call to

           LDAA  $09,SP       ; the sub, and all parameter passing. A call to this sub
           LDAB  $06,SP       ; would look like this:
           MUL                ; LDD   Operand1    ; I used D to illustrate, but this should
           ADDB  $02,SP       ; PSHD              ; also work using an index register, or a
           ADCA  #0           ; LDD   Operand2    ; MOVW instruction. Placing values on the

           LDAA  $08,SP       ; JSR   MULU_16_16  ; Call the sub.
           LDAB  $07,SP       ; PULD              ; Most significant word of product.
           MUL                ; PULD              ; Least significant word of product.
           ADDB  $02,SP       
           ADCA  $01,SP       ; READ THIS DAMMIT! You MUST re-adjust the stack after calling 
           STD   $01,SP       ; MULU_16_16 even if you aren't interested in the result.

           LDAA  $08,SP       ; What's more, you MUST PLACE four bytes on the stack before
           LDAB  $06,SP       ; calling MULU_16_16. If you do not do either of these things,
           MUL                ; your program will get a nice surprise when you try to RTS
           ADDB  $01,SP       ; next. Remember, this function modifies values on the stack
           ADCA  #0           ; that were placed there BEFORE the return address from the JSR
           STD   $00,SP       ; that called it. 

           PULD               ; Destroy the stack space we created at the beginning of this
