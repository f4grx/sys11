linker
------
the linker builds a binary image using object files and section placement information

the linker script gives a list of segments and starting addresses
usually text and edata addresses

-build full section list (stored in temp file)
-for each section,
  - check each object input file in order
    - copy section contents if needed to a temp file for this section.
    - apply LOC relocations
    - build list of global symbols
then at the end
-for each section,
  - apply ABS relocations using extern/global references

final pass: binary emission
Several types of binary files:
-raw binary image for flashing to monitor EPROM
-loadable binary with segment information
